This project was created in a team of 5 as a part of a my course work for Masterâ€™s in Arizona State University.

Our Vision
We aim to modify current SANA mobile client so that Patients can utilize the current SANA infrastructure on their personal devices. 
To start with we have integrated PROMIS Pain management android app with SANA mobile client. 
With the OpenMRS patient management portal, Doctor would be directly able to send notifications to user to its mobile client.
